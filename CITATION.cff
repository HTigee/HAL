  Hybrid Automata Library (HAL) is a Java library that
  facilitates hybrid modeling: spatial models with
  interacting agent-based and partial-differential equation
  components. HALâ€™s components can be broadly classified
  into: agent containers (on and off-lattice), finite
  difference diffusion fields, graphical user interface
  (GUI) components, and additional tools or utilities for
  computation and data manipulation. These components have a
  standardized interface that expedites the construction,
  analysis, and visualization of complex models.
